# Welcome to the command line.

# Isn't it lovely?

# This is how you do anything on powerful computers, and powerful things on your computer.

# In the command line you type commands.

# When you hit Enter, the command gets executed (unless the line starts with a #, in which case it's ignored.)

# Sometimes they are simple.

# For example, try typing `pwd` like so:

pwd

# That prints where you are in the file system.

# Sometimes commands take arguments, like the `man` command, which is the command line manual.

# It works by writing what you want to learn about after saying `man`.

# For example, say we would like to know about the `pwd` command.

man pwd

# You can type `q` to exit.

# You can learn about many commands this way. If the manual is long, you can step through it by pressing your space bar.

man man

# Again quitting with `q`.

# Let's start by making some directories. These are the equivalent of "folders" on your graphical desktop.

# We make them using `mkdir`:

mkdir mary
mkdir poppins

# We go into directories using the `cd` command, which is short for "change directory".

cd poppins

pwd

# As you can see, we are now in the `poppins` directory.

# Now we are going to make our first file using `cat >`.

# This is will involve "redirection," which is a little tricky, but we'll cover that in a later screencast.

# Just imagine that `cat >` is one command and we can pull it apart later.

cat > super.txt
Now I can type whatever I like.

When trying to express oneself, it's frankly quite absurd,
To leaf through lengthy lexicons to find the perfect word.
A little spontaniaty keeps conversation keen,
You need to find a way to say, precisely what you mean...

Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious!
Even though the sound of it is something quite atrosicous!
If you say it loud enough, you'll always sound precocious,

Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious!
Um-diddle-diddle-um-diddleye
Um-diddle-diddle-um-diddleye

When it's time to exit this text entry, just hit control-d

# OK, now we should have a file called `super.txt`.

# We can see if it worked by typing `ls`.

# It did!

# We can now view the file by using `cat` again, but without the `>`

cat super.txt

# When names of directories and files gets too long, it can be annoying to type the whole thing.

# To avoid this, type part of the name, and then press the Tab key.

cat sup

# Cool!

# OK, remember now that we are in the `poppins` directory.

pwd

# We go "up" a directory, i.e. leaving the current directory for its enclosing directory, by typing `cd ..`.

pwd

ls
ls poppins
ls mary


# That's all for now.
