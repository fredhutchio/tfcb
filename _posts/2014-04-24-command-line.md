Powerful things happen with computers on the "command line".

You can get on the command line on a mac via the `Terminal` application.
On Windows you can follow [Michael G's instructions](https://teams.fhcrc.org/sites/citwiki/SciComp/Training%20Materials/Unix%20101/Slides.html#slide3).

Here is a little demonstration of the command line I just made:

<script type="text/javascript" src="https://asciinema.org/a/9111.js" id="asciicast-9111" async></script>

Note that you can pause the presentation at any time, and you can copy things from it and paste them into your own command line.

It's silent, so if you feel lonely you can listen to this, and feel hip at the same time:

If you would like to learn more, we will be covering a lot more in the future.
But if you are impatient, I would suggest the [LinuxCommand.org introduction](http://linuxcommand.org/lc3_learning_the_shell.php).
